/**
 * A rule-of-thumb bandwidth selection strategy.
 * <p>
 * The optimal bandwidth for a finite difference derivative is given by:<br>
 * \[[\frac{d}{n}\frac{1}{|C_{n}|}(\epsilon |F_{\epsilon}| + \delta |F_{\delta}|)]^\frac{1}{n + d}\]<br>
 * where
 * <table border="0">
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>\(d\)</td>
 *   <td>The derivative order.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>\(n\)</td>
 *   <td>The error order.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>\(\epsilon\)</td>
 *   <td>The condition error.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *   <td>\(F_\epsilon\)</td>
 *   <td>The condition error coefficient.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>\(\delta\)</td>
 *   <td>The cancellation error.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>\(F_\delta\)</td>
 *   <td>The cancellation error coefficient.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>\(C_{n}\)</td>
 *   <td>The truncation error.</td>
 *  </tr>
 * </table>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Our rule-of-thumb is derived by first using the "simplified" forms of the
 * condition and cancellation error. Specifically, this means that
 * (\F_{\epsilon} = |f_{0}| \sum |c_{i}|/) and F_{\delta} = \frac{|f_{0}| \sum
 * |c_{i}|}{2}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Re-arranging, and absorbing \(|f_{0}|\) into the trunction error term:<br>
 * \[[(\frac{d}{n}) \cdot |x^{*}| \cdot\sum |c_{i}| \cdot (\epsilon +
 * \frac{\delta}{2})]^\frac{1}{n + d}\]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here, \(x^{*}\) essentially measures scale of the curvature of the function
 * near x. The rule-of-thumb then sets \(x^{*}\) equal to x itself (except near
 * zero). Although this may seem either trivial or entirely unrealistic, this
 * choice makes no assumptions about the particular form of the function and
 * works quite well in practice.
